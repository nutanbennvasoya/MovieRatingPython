## ðŸ“Œ Project Tasks

### âœ… Task 1: Reading and Inspection
- Load the movie dataset using pandas
- Inspect the structure and null values

### âœ… Task 2: Data Cleaning
- Drop unnecessary columns
- Remove rows with high percentage of null values
- Fill missing values (e.g., language with 'English')
- Check the percentage of rows retained
- Remove duplicates

### âœ… Task 3: Feature Engineering
- Convert `gross` and `budget` from $ to million $
- Create a new column `profit` = `gross - budget`
- Add a `decade` column from `title_year`
- Extract first 2 or 3 genres from `genres` column into new columns
- Create a ranking column for IMDb Top 250 movies

### âœ… Task 4: Grouping and Aggregation
- Group by `director_name` to find top 10 directors based on average IMDb score
- Group by genre combinations
- Group by actors for review analysis

### âœ… Task 5: Visualization
- Bar chart of average IMDb score by genre
- Scatter plot for `profit` vs `budget`
- Count plot of movies per decade
